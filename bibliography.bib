  ABSTRACT = {In 1988 the Church–Rosser languages were introduced by McNaughton et al. as those languages that are recognized by finite, length-reducing and confluent string-rewriting systems using extra non-terminal symbols. Here we generalize this concept by considering classes of languages that are obtained by other types of string-rewriting systems. To honour Robert McNaughton's original contribution we call the resulting families of languages McNaughton families. Here it is shown that the concept of McNaughton families is as powerful as the notion of Turing machine or the notion of phrase-structure grammar. We investigate the relationships between the various McNaughton families, obtaining an extensive hierarchy of classes that includes many well-known language and complexity classes as well as some new classes. Further, we consider some closure and non-closure properties for those McNaughton families that are contained in the class of context-free languages, and we address the complexity of the fixed and the general membership problems for these families.}

  ABSTRACT = {Restarting automata were introduced as a model for analysis by reduction, which is a linguistically motivated method for checking correctness of a sentence. We propose a new restricted version of restarting automata called clearing restarting automata with a very simple definition but simultaneously with interesting properties with respect to their possible applications. The new model can be learned very efficiently from positive examples and its stronger version can be used to learn effectively a large class of languages. We relate the class of languages recognized by clearing restarting automata to the Chomsky hierarchy.},

  ABSTRACT = {The question of whether there is an automaton with n states which agrees with a finite set D of data is shown to be NP-complete, although identification-in-the-limit of finite automata is possible in polynomial time as a function of the size of D. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for D to be realizable by an automaton whose states are reachable from the initial state by a given set T of input strings. Although this question is also NP-complete, these conditions suggest heuristic approaches. Even if a solution to this problem were available, it is shown that finding a minimal set T does not necessarily give the smallest possible T.}

  ABSTRACT = {This classic book on formal languages, automata theory, and computational complexity has been updated to present theoretical concepts in a concise and straightforward manner with the increase of hands-on, practical applications. This new edition comes with Gradiance, an online assessment tool developed for computer science. Gradiance is the most advanced online assessment tool developed for the computer science discipline. With its innovative underlying technology, Gradiance turns basic homework assignments and programming labs into an interactive learning experience for students. By using a series of root questions and hints, it not only tests a student's capability, but actually simulates a one-on-one teacher-student tutorial that allows for the student to more easily learn the material. Through the programming labs, instructors are capable of testing, tracking, and honing their students' skills, both in terms of syntax and semantics, with an unprecedented level of assessment never before offered.},

                  from Czech, a language with a relatively high degree
                  of word-order freedom. The paper sums up the basic features
                  of methods of dependency syntax. The method serves as a basis
                  for the verification (and explanation) of the adequacy of formal
                  and computational models of those methods.},

  ABSTRACT =     {The restarting automaton was introduced by Jan{\v c}ar et al. in 1995 in
                  order to model the so-called ``analysis by
                  reduction,'' which is a technique used in
                  linguistics to analyse sentences of natural
                  languages that have a free word order. By now
                  there are many different models of restarting
                  automata, and their investigation has proved very
                  fruitful in that they offer an opportunity to
                  study the influence of various kinds of resources
                  on their expressive power. Here we introduce and
                  discuss the main variants of these automata, and
                  present the main results that have been obtained
                  until now. In particular, we investigate the
                  relationship of the language classes that are
                  defined through the various types of restarting
                  automata to the classes of the Chomsky hierarchy,
                  and we address some open problems.},

  ABSTRACT = {In the literature various types of restarting automata have been studied that are 
              based on contextual rewriting. A word w is accepted by such an automaton if, starting 
              from the initial configuration that corresponds to input w, the word w is reduced to 
              the empty word by a finite number of applications of these contextual rewritings. 
              This approach is reminiscent of the notion of McNaughton families of languages. 
              Here we put the aforementioned types of restarting automata into the context of 
              McNaughton families of languages, relating the classes of languages accepted by 
              these automata in particular to the class GCSL of growing context-sensitive languages 
              and to the class CRL of Churchâ€“Rosser languages.},
